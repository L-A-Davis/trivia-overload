# Trivia Overload

## Overview

Trivia Overload is a trivia game created in vanilla Javascript. The game is a traditional multiple choice quiz, with a few twistsâ€“ questions pop up in random places on the page, sometimes overlapping each other, every correct answer causes questions to appear more quickly, and every wrong answer stays on the screen.

## Playing the Game

To play the game a user provides their name, and what category of questions they would like to answer. 

Most questions are drawn from [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php), but if the user would like, the ability to add their own questions is available.
The categories are borrowed from the Open Trivia Database, though user created questions get a section, as well as a collection of every question the user has gotten wrong.

Once the user and category are selected, hitting 'Start Game' prompts a countdown, which once finished marks the start of the game.
Questions then pop on the screen at a slow pace, but as the user answers questions they will appear more rapidly. Any wrong answers will stay on the screen, possibly blocking other questions from being answered!

The game ends once there are three incorrect answers or all questions have been exhausted.

Player stats may be seen from the user/category selection screen once a player has been chosen.
